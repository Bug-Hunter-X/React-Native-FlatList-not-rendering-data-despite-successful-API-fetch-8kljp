# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where a React Native FlatList component fails to render data fetched successfully from an API.  The issue is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently, often appearing after certain application lifecycle events or during rapid state changes.

## Bug Description
The application correctly retrieves data from an API endpoint.  However, the FlatList component remains empty, despite the data being available in the application's state.  No errors are thrown, and the loading indicator correctly disappears, suggesting successful data retrieval.  The behavior is inconsistent, making debugging challenging.

## Reproduction Steps

Reproducing the bug is inconsistent. It can sometime appear after navigating between several screens or loading data quickly.  The bug does not appear when running under a debugging tool.
